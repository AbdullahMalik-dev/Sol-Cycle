CRYO-SHATTER FINANCE MODEL

1. Start-Up Fund (Estimated Budget)

Because this is a Mars mission, all costs are Earth launch + Mars operations. A realistic low-tech system budget:
	‚Ä¢	Sonic Pulverizer Unit (resonant frequency generator, durable, modular): $15M
	‚Ä¢	Automated Sieving & Sorting System: $5M
	‚Ä¢	Storage/Processing Bins (lightweight, modular): $3M
	‚Ä¢	Structural Integration (mini-brick press, ice-composite molders): $7M
	‚Ä¢	Research, Testing, Integration (Earth simulation before flight): $10M

üëâ Total Start-Up = ~$40M

(This is ‚Äúcheap‚Äù in NASA terms‚Äîlaunching 1kg to Mars can cost $2,000‚Äì$10,000, so recycling saves $$$ in the long run.)

2. Materials Needed to Produce System

Your system is designed to be low-mass + multifunctional (important for space).
	‚Ä¢	Base Equipment:
‚Ä¢ Sonic Pulverizer (50‚Äì100 kg)
‚Ä¢ Vibration/sorting sieves (30‚Äì50 kg)
‚Ä¢ Brick molds + ice integration unit (20‚Äì30 kg)
	‚Ä¢	Energy Requirements:
‚Ä¢ Uses Martian night cold (free) to freeze ‚Üí no energy cost
‚Ä¢ Only energy needed = vibration + sorting (can be powered by solar or nuclear battery)
‚Ä¢ Estimated power draw: ~2 kW
	‚Ä¢	Raw Input:
‚Ä¢ Crew‚Äôs own trash (packaging, textiles, structural waste)
‚Ä¢ Martian ice (abundant in many regions)

üëâ Basically: once launched, no extra feedstock from Earth is needed.

3. Potential Return on Investment (ROI)

Instead of flying in new materials, you reuse what you have. Let‚Äôs compare costs:
	‚Ä¢	1 kg launch to Mars = ~$10,000 (average NASA estimate).
	‚Ä¢	Your system recycles 12,600 kg of waste ‚Üí saves ~$126,000,000 in resupply cost.

Returns (in usable materials):
	‚Ä¢	Plastics (40%) ~5,000 kg ‚Üí 3D-printing tools & spare parts.
	‚Ä¢	Metals (30%) ~3,800 kg ‚Üí brackets, shielding, machine parts.
	‚Ä¢	Textiles (20%) ~2,500 kg ‚Üí insulation, rope, fabric composites.
	‚Ä¢	Glass (10%) ~1,300 kg ‚Üí panels, insulation fibers.

‚∏ª

‚ö° Financial summary:
	‚Ä¢	Start-Up Cost: ~$40M
	‚Ä¢	Material Savings: ~$126M
	‚Ä¢	Net Return (ROI): ~$86M in mission value + priceless survival benefits (tools, shelter, water supply).
